# Changelog

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-10

### New Feature
  - **MCP server** — opt-in localhost MCP server (`esp-decoder.mcp.enabled`, streamable HTTP at `http://127.0.0.1:37373/mcp`) so AI agents such as Claude Code can drive the monitor: connect/disconnect, cursor-based serial log tailing, send/hard-reset, crash listing & backtrace decoding, and firmware upload (`pio run -t upload` / `idf.py flash` as a VS Code task with automatic serial-port release/reacquire). New command **ESP Decoder: Copy MCP Server URL**. See [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md); a ready-made Claude Code skill ships in `skills/esp-decoder-mcp/`.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-05-18

### New Feature
  - **Reset button** - new toolbar button performs a hard-reset of the connected ESP chip by toggling the RTS/EN line, mirroring `esptool reset_chip("hard-reset")`. Enabled while connected; disabled otherwise.
  - **Filter save** - operations now provide visual feedback to users, confirming successful saves with "Saved ✓" messages or displaying error details if an issue occurs. Save button shows a disabled state while processing and displays timed feedback that clearly indicates whether the operation succeeded or failed.

## [0.26.4] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- **Serial Monitor — baud rate selection** - preset baud rate options and custom input support for flexible baud rate selection. Quick selection menu displays preset rates with custom option when needed (#61)

## [0.26.3] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- **Serial Monitor — high-ASCII input** — characters `> 0x7F` typed in the serial input were silently mangled before reaching the device. The serial `write()` call now uses `latin1` encoding (`Buffer.from(data, 'latin1')`), so every character in `0x00–0xFF` is sent as its exact single byte instead of being expanded into a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence (#59).
- **Terminal line wrap** - finally fixed

## [0.26.2] - 2026-05-17

### Revert
- **PR #54** - since it generates faulty empty line

### Changed
- **Terminal width** - adjusting spacing and ensuring content renders properly without unwanted horizontal overflow.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- **Serial Monitor — bare CR (`\r`) is now visible** — output such as `printf(" wait %is \r ", i)` used to be invisible because a bare CR cleared the current line in-place, and the post-CR text overwrote it within the same synchronous render batch. Bare CR is now treated as a line terminator (like LF / CRLF), so each iteration of the user's loop appears on its own line (#54).

## [0.26.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **"Upload and Monitor" task interception** — when pioarduino runs its combined "Upload and Monitor" task, ESP Decoder now intercepts it before the CLI monitor can open (#52).
  - The combined task is terminated immediately; a synthetic upload-only task (with `--target monitor` stripped) runs in its place.
  - On successful upload (exit code `0`), `esp-decoder.openMonitor` is called with `autoConnect: true`, replacing the CLI terminal with the ESP Decoder serial monitor.
  - Baud rate is resolved automatically from `monitor_speed` in `platformio.ini` via a new `getMonitorBaudRate()` helper in `pioIntegration.ts`.
  - Spurious `onDidUpload` events fired when the combined task is killed are suppressed via `suppressingCombinedTask` + `syntheticUploadExecutions` guards to prevent unwanted port reacquisition.
  - A 10 s safety timeout ensures the synthetic upload starts even if the original task is slow to terminate.
  - Retry-based port reacquisition (5 attempts, linear back-off from 300 ms) handles OS-level USB device hold after flashing.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Programmatic API for pioarduino integration** — the monitor command now accepts optional `port` and `baudRate` parameters, enabling callers (e.g. pioarduino) to open the serial terminal with a pre-selected port and baud rate (#51).
  - Automatic connection is triggered when the monitor is opened with port parameters.
  - New `setPort(port)` and `setBaudRate(rate)` APIs allow dynamically configuring the serial port from an external caller.
  - `setPort` trims input and rejects empty/whitespace-only strings to prevent invalid connections.
  - `setBaudRate` enforces integer-only baud rates (decimal values such as `115200.5` are rejected).
  - Auto-connect reconnect guard correctly handles baud-rate-only changes (`portChanged || baudChanged`) by capturing `prevPort` and `prevBaud` before applying new options.

## [0.24.2] - 2026-05-05

### Added
  - **Auto-reconnect** - for unexpected serial monitor disconnections (configurable, off by default).
  - Settings: enable/disable auto-reconnect and set timeout (ms, default 15000).
  - Auto-reconnect only triggers for unexpected disconnects; user-initiated or suspended disconnects are ignored.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Port filtering** — integrated platform-specific port filters to exclude non-serial devices:
  - **macOS**: Filters out Bluetooth and debug ports (`.Bluetooth`, `.debug` matches Bluetooth/debug-style paths).
  - **Linux**: Filters out system serial ports (`ttyS*`) and Bluetooth RFCOMM ports (`rfcomm`).
  - **Windows**: Filters out Bluetooth devices by manufacturer name.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Clickable file:line in Serial Monitor** — log lines containing source-file references (e.g. `src/main.cpp:42`, `/path/to/MyLib.cpp:15:7`, or Windows paths like `C:\Users\me\My Project\main.cpp:42`) are now detected and rendered as Ctrl/Cmd+click links that jump straight to the matching file/line in the editor, mirroring the legacy PlatformIO monitor behavior (#41).
  - Supports absolute, drive-letter, and workspace-relative paths; relative paths are resolved against the active workspace folders, with a `findFiles` fallback by basename when the path can't be located directly.
  - Plain mouse clicks still select text normally; the pointer/underline only appear while the modifier key is held (synced from both keyboard and pointer events so it works even when the modifier was pressed before the webview gained focus).

## [0.23.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Regression: Offline crash decoding** — pasted crash logs (Decode Log) are decoded correctly again. The crash capturer is flushed immediately after feeding pasted data, ensuring the crash block is finalized and decoded (#38).

## [0.23.1] - 2026-04-28

### revert to build [0.22.2]
- **broken 0.23.0**

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-28

### Changed
- **Vendored trbr runtime integration** — `trbr` is now fully vendored under `src/vendor/trbr` and used directly by `src/crashDecoder.ts`, removing the external runtime dependency and related build externals (#38).
- **Crash capture pipeline cleanup** — legacy fallback/workaround paths were removed in favor of the integrated trbr framer/capturer flow, reducing duplicate crash-detection logic (#38).

### Fixed
- **ESP8266 frame finalization** — crash blocks now finalize immediately when the `<<<stack<<<` end marker is received (in addition to `Rebooting...`), avoiding delayed emit via quiet-timeout (#38).
- **RISC-V register mapping consistency** — decoder paths now use a single source of truth for ILP32 register metadata (`gdbRegsInfoRiscvIlp32`) to avoid layout mismatches (#38).
- **Dual-core coreId decoding** — fixed coreId handling for two-core MCUs in the decode path (#38).
- **ESP32-C5 target support** — added target handling required for ESP32-C5 decoding flow (#38).

## [0.22.2] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Serial Monitor — selectable line ending** — New dropdown next to the Send button lets you choose the line terminator appended to outgoing commands: `CRLF (\r\n)` (default, unchanged behavior), `LF (\n)`, `CR (\r)` or `None`. The choice is remembered across panel reloads and VS Code restarts via webview `localStorage` (#34).

## [0.22.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Serial Monitor — blank lines** — Empty lines in device output (e.g. consecutive `\n\n`) are now rendered as visible blank rows instead of collapsing to zero height (#35).
- **Serial Monitor — ANSI color with Timestamp** — When the `Timestamp` filter is enabled, multi-line coloured output (e.g. an `ESP_LOGI` message containing embedded newlines) now keeps its colour on every line. Previously the timestamp's `\x1b[0m` reset wiped the active SGR state, causing all but the first line to render uncoloured (#35).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Enhanced ANSI color output rendering:** — The viewer now supports extended color formats including 256-color palette selections and full true RGB color sequences.

### Fixed
- **ANSI color** — Wrong blink for ANSI escape code `\033[38;5;xxxm`

## [0.21.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Windows ARM64** — Fixed bug `Writing to COM port (GetOverlappedResult): Invalid handle` caused from `serialport/bindings-cpp` (`npm:@jason2866/serialport-bindings-cpp`).

## [0.21.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Linux ARM64** — Fixed bug in build proccess of `serialport/bindings-cpp` (`npm:@jason2866/serialport-bindings-cpp@^13.0.4`).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **ESP8266 crash decode support** — full crash detection and decoding for ESP8266 `Exception (N):` crashes with `>>>stack>>>` / `<<<stack<<<` stack dumps.
  - Exception cause lookup (e.g. Exception 28 → LoadProhibited).
  - Register parsing for ESP8266 format (`epc1=`, `excvaddr=`, `depc=`).
  - Heuristic stack address extraction from ESP8266 hex dump lines.
  - Fast-path addr2line resolution for stack addresses (same pattern as Xtensa Backtrace).
  - Fallback-based crash detection — works around trbr framer limitations (case-sensitive `detectKind`, missing `>>>stack>>>` flush guard).

## [0.20.1] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Windows ARM64** — port could not be opened. Fixed by using a patched fork of `serialport/bindings-cpp` (`npm:@jason2866/serialport-bindings-cpp@^13.0.2`).

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Serial monitor filter toolbar** — a new filter toolbar lets you transform, suppress, and annotate incoming serial output in real time. All filter settings are persisted via the **Save** button to VS Code settings (`esp-decoder.serialFilters.*`).
  - **Timestamp filter** — prepends a dimmed `[HH:MM:SS.mmm]` timestamp to every line.
  - **Suppress filter** — hides lines matching a user-defined regex.
  - **Highlight filter** — wraps regex matches in ANSI inverse-video styling to make them visually stand out.
  - **Dedup filter** — collapses repeated regex matches within a single line after a configurable threshold, showing a live `×N` counter badge instead.
  - **Log2File** — writes incoming serial data to a timestamped log file on disk, with optional filtered mode that applies Suppress, Timestamp, and Dedup filters before writing. Automatically closes and reopens log files across pioarduino upload cycles.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Automatic serial port handoff with pioarduino IDE** — ESP Decoder now subscribes to the `onWillUpload` / `onDidUpload` events exported by the pioarduino IDE extension. When pioarduino starts a flash operation, ESP Decoder automatically releases the serial port so the upload tool can access it, then reconnects immediately afterwards without any user interaction.
  - Port release uses a `waitUntil()` barrier: pioarduino blocks the upload until ESP Decoder confirms the port is fully closed — no race conditions.
  - Port-aware release: only releases the connection when the upload targets the same physical device (handles macOS `/dev/cu.*` ↔ `/dev/tty.*` aliases and Windows case-insensitive COM port names).
  - Retry-based reacquire: reconnects immediately after upload completion with exponential back-off (up to 5 attempts) instead of a fixed delay.
  - Serial port close errors now propagate correctly so a failed release aborts the upload rather than proceeding with the port still open.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Monitor location setting** — users can now choose between opening the ESP Crash Monitor in the bottom panel (default, introduced in v0.11.0) or as an editor tab (legacy behavior). Configure via `esp-decoder.monitorLocation` setting.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Command history in serial monitor** — use Up/Down arrow keys to navigate through previously sent commands. History stores up to 100 commands and avoids consecutive duplicates.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-28

### Changed

- **Tool missing warning** — ESP Decoder shows now a warning when needed GDB/addr2line tools are not found.
- **Improved PlatformIO .elf detection** — Enhanced search for compiled .elf files to support non-standard PlatformIO setups, including custom build directories, multiple .elf files per environment, and custom-named firmware files.
- **Better error classification** — Improved detection of tool-missing errors to avoid false positives from decode failures, malformed ELF files, or other non-tool-related issues.

### Maintenance

- **Security updates** — Updated esbuild to 0.27.4 and vitest to 4.1.2.
- **Code quality** — Refactored path expansion logic in PlatformIO integration to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- **Monitor moved to bottom panel** — the ESP Crash Monitor now opens as a webview view in the bottom panel area (next to Terminal, Output, etc.) instead of an editor tab. The view is registered under its own "ESP Decoder" panel container and can be freely rearranged by the user.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **PlatformIO project-local `core_dir` support** — when `platformio.ini` specifies a `core_dir` under `[platformio]`, packages, board definitions, and tools are now resolved from that directory instead of the global PlatformIO core. Path semantics supported: relative paths (resolved against the workspace folder), leading `~` (expanded to the home directory), and `${sysenv.VAR}` tokens (substituted from environment variables).

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Corrupted multi-byte UTF-8 characters in serial monitor** — signal-strength bar characters (`▂▄▆█`) and other multi-byte Unicode characters are no longer replaced with `�` when they are split across consecutive serial-port data chunks. The serial data handler now uses Node.js `StringDecoder` which buffers incomplete byte sequences until the next chunk completes them.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **ANSI color support in serial monitor** — the terminal now renders ANSI SGR escape sequences (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, 8 standard foreground/background colors) instead of displaying raw escape characters. Modeled after the esp32tool implementation.


## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **PlatformIO core directory detection** — use `getCoreDir()` from `pioarduino-node-helpers` instead of hardcoded `os.homedir()`, correctly handling `PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR` env var and Windows edge cases.


## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **coredump decode** supported format `*.bin` and `*.b64`

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Native IDF support** contributed by [h2zero](https://github.com/h2zero)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-10

### Bug fixes

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Scroll-to-bottom button** in the serial monitor — a prominent button now appears when the output is not scrolled to the bottom, allowing quick navigation to the latest output.
- **Upload artifact step** in the CI build job — the compiled `.vsix` extension package is now stored as a downloadable artifact on every successful build.
- **Restored publish job** in the GitHub Actions workflow with corrected `needs` dependency and permissions.

### Changed / Improved
- **Increased decoding speed** — overall crash decoding performance has been improved.

### Fixed
- **Serial monitor slowdown at high baud rates** — serial data is now batched in 50 ms intervals before being sent to the webview, preventing IPC message queue flooding that caused the UI to become unresponsive.
- **Post-disconnect message flooding** — pending flush is cancelled and the buffer is discarded on disconnect, stopping queued messages from draining for minutes after the device is unplugged.
- **Autoscroll layout reflows** — autoscroll now uses `requestAnimationFrame` instead of synchronous DOM updates to avoid forced layout reflows on every incoming message.
- **Line-buffer trimming performance** — replaced repeated `Array.shift()` (O(n²)) with `Array.slice(-maxLines)` and `replaceChildren()` for a single-DOM-operation trim.
- **Autoscroll re-enable on manual scroll** — autoscroll is correctly re-enabled when the user manually scrolls back to the bottom of the output.
- **Autoscroll race condition** — programmatic `scrollTop` updates are now guarded with a `programmaticScroll` flag so that scroll events triggered by the extension itself do not incorrectly disable autoscroll.
