# ESP Crash Decoder — VS Code Extension

Decode ESP32x/ESP8266 crash dumps directly from the serial port in VS Code.  
Designed to work with [**pioarduino**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pioarduino.pioarduino-ide) and
[**Espressif IDF**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension).

## Features

- **Serial Monitor** — Connect to any serial port, view output in real-time
- **Automatic Crash Detection** — Detects Guru Meditation Errors, backtraces, panics, asserts
- **Crash Decoding** — Decodes stack traces using `addr2line`/GDB from espressif toolchains
- **PlatformIO Integration** — Auto-detects `firmware.elf` and toolchain from `.pio/build/`
- **ESP-IDF Integration** — Auto-detects app ELF and toolchain from `build/` and ESP-IDF tools
- **Click-to-Navigate** — Click on decoded file:line references to open source files
- **Register Display** — Shows CPU register values at the time of crash
- **Multi-Arch Support** — Xtensa (ESP32/S2/S3) and RISC-V (ESP32-C3/C6/H2)
- **WiFi Provisioning** — Hand WiFi credentials to the connected board over the [Improv serial protocol](https://www.improv-wifi.com/serial/) (no browser required)

## Quick Start

1. Open a pioarduino or ESP-IDF project in VS Code
2. Build your firmware (`pio run` or `idf.py build`)
3. Run command: **ESP Decoder: Open Serial Monitor & Crash Decoder**
4. Select serial port and connect
5. The ELF file is auto-detected from `.pio/build/` or `build/`
6. Crash dumps are automatically detected and decoded

## WiFi Provisioning (Improv)

If the running firmware implements the
[Improv serial protocol](https://www.improv-wifi.com/serial/) (e.g. the ESP-IDF
`improv` component or the Arduino `improv-wifi` library), you can provision WiFi
credentials directly from the monitor — no Chrome/WebSerial and no fighting over
the port:

1. Connect to the board in the serial monitor.
2. Click the **WiFi** button in the toolbar.
3. The extension queries device info and scans nearby networks; pick one (or type
   an SSID), enter the password, and click **Provision**.
4. On success the device's `next-url` (e.g. its setup page) is shown.

The serial monitor pauses while provisioning (the raw byte stream is routed to
the Improv parser) and resumes when the dialog closes. The per-command timeout is
configurable via `esp-decoder.improv.timeout`. AI agents can do the same headless
via the `provision_wifi` MCP tool. Provisioning is a no-op (times out with a clear
message) if the firmware does not speak Improv.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `esp-decoder.defaultBaudRate` | `115200` | Default baud rate |
| `esp-decoder.autoDetectElf` | `true` | Auto-detect ELF from PlatformIO and ESP-IDF builds |
| `esp-decoder.elfPath` | `""` | Manual ELF file path |
| `esp-decoder.toolPath` | `""` | Manual GDB/addr2line path |
| `esp-decoder.targetArch` | `auto` | Target architecture (`auto`, `xtensa`, `riscv32`) |
| `esp-decoder.serialMonitor.maxLines` | `5000` | Max lines in serial output |
| `esp-decoder.serialMonitor.autoscroll` | `true` | Auto-scroll on new data |
| `esp-decoder.logDirectory` | `logs` | Directory for Log2File output (relative to workspace by default) |
| `esp-decoder.mcp.enabled` | `false` | Run a localhost MCP server so AI agents can drive the monitor |
| `esp-decoder.mcp.port` | `37373` | TCP port for the MCP server |
| `esp-decoder.improv.timeout` | `30000` | Per-command timeout (ms) for Improv-WiFi provisioning |

## MCP Server (AI Agent Integration)

When `esp-decoder.mcp.enabled` is set, the extension hosts an MCP
(Model Context Protocol) server at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp` (streamable
HTTP, bound to localhost only). An AI agent such as Claude Code can then drive
the monitor: connect/disconnect the serial port, tail the log, upload
firmware, and decode detected crashes — while the webview keeps displaying the
same stream.

Register with Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http esp-decoder http://127.0.0.1:37373/mcp
```

Available tools: `list_ports`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `get_status`,
`read_serial` (cursor-based log tailing), `send_serial`, `hard_reset`,
`provision_wifi` (Improv-WiFi serial provisioning), `list_crashes`,
`decode_crash`, `upload_firmware` (runs `pio run -t upload` or
`idf.py flash` as a VS Code task, releasing/reacquiring the serial port
around the flash), and `list_environments`.

See [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md) for full documentation and
[skills/esp-decoder-mcp/](skills/esp-decoder-mcp/SKILL.md) for a ready-made
Claude Code agent skill.

## How It Works

1. Serial data is received and displayed in the **Serial Monitor** tab
2. Incoming lines are analyzed for crash patterns (panic messages, backtraces, register dumps)
3. When a crash block is detected, it appears in the **Crash Events** tab
4. If an ELF file is configured, the crash is automatically decoded:
   - Backtrace addresses are resolved to function names and source locations
   - Stack memory is resolved to function names and source locations
   - Register values are extracted and displayed
   - Fault information (cause, core, address) is shown
5. Clicking on source file references opens the file at the correct line

## pioarduino Setup

The extension auto-detects:

- **ELF file**: `<workspace>/.pio/build/<env>/firmware.elf`
- **Toolchain**: From packages (`~/.platformio/packages/`)
- **Architecture**: From board configuration in `platformio.ini`

Make sure you have built your project at least once before connecting the monitor.

## ESP-IDF Setup

The extension auto-detects:

- **ELF file**: `<workspace>/build/<project>.elf`
- **Toolchain**: From `PATH` or ESP-IDF tools (`$IDF_TOOLS_PATH/tools`, `~/.espressif/tools`)
- **Architecture**: From `sdkconfig` (`CONFIG_IDF_TARGET`)

Make sure you have built your project at least once with `idf.py build` before connecting the monitor.

## Building the Extension

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run build
npm run package   # Creates .vsix file
```

## Installing

```bash
code --install-extension esp-decoder-0.1.0.vsix
```

Or install from the Extensions sidebar: "Install from VSIX..."

## Releasing

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version's entry.
2. On a clean `main`, run one of:

   ```bash
   npm run version:patch   # or version:minor / version:major
   ```

   This bumps `package.json`, commits `chore(release): X.Y.Z`, creates the
   `vX.Y.Z` tag, and pushes the commit and tag. The Build workflow then creates a
   GitHub Release (with auto-generated notes and the `.vsix` attached) and
   publishes to the VS Code Marketplace.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85+
- Node.js 18+ (for the `serialport` native module)
- One supported build environment:
   - pioarduino (for PlatformIO-based projects), or
   - ESP-IDF toolchain (for pure ESP-IDF projects)
- A built firmware (`.elf` file) generated by `pio run` or `idf.py build`
